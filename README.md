# The Interface

This is the simple Interface that Funcatron uses.
Implement the Func interface and you're ready to go.

Just include the `[funcatron/intf "0.1-SNAPSHOT"]` artifact
and a `funcatron.json` or `funcatron.yml` file in a JAR
and [Bob's your Uncle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob%27s_your_uncle).
